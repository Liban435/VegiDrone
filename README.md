VegiDrone

An e-commerce website called Vegidrone that sells fruits and vegetables from the source (farmers) directly to the consumers, 
cutting out the middlemen (grocery stores). Conceptually we have created a database with our farmers that we 
partnered with in Ontario (In the future across Canada and USA), and within that database we have each of our farmers stock of 
fruit and vegetables updated live on our site so that the consumer will never order our product if there is no stock available. 
Our store is a concept store that is looking to disrupt the agriculture supply chain by laying the foundational infrastructure 
for drone delivery systems in the food industry. In the future, we will set up a system that as soon as you order our site will 
tell you when the next available drone will deliver your order (assuming you are in our delivery jurisdiction) and will track the 
flight and time of the drone. 

Our site looks similar to a standard shopping site with different features such as produce that is on sale, produce that is in season, 
recently viewed produce, produce we think you will enjoy based off your recent search history, produce bundles and packages that you can 
purchase and reviews/FAQ. We also have an interactive map, for example, it would show a map of Ontario and there will be dots on the map 
representing farms that we partner with. When you click on the dot it will show some brief information about the farm and some 
contact information and maybe even a link to the farm's social media or website to offer transparency to the consumer. We will also 
make a chatbot that can answer general questions and direct the consumer to different parts of the site or show some deals.
